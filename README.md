# Kellogg Computing Orientation Workshop
Code and instructions for the Kellogg Research Support computing orientation workshop

## Important Pre-work
Before coming to the workshop, you'll need to do a few things. First, log onto the Kellogg Linux Cluster (KLC). Second, clone this git repository to your home directory on KLC. At that point you will have access to all of these materials, exactly where you'll need to have them in order to participate in the workshop.

Instructions for performing this pre-work have been added to the current repository's wiki:

https://github.com/rs-kellogg/computing-orientation/wiki

We also ask that you complete a few small tasks:

1.) Read Gentzkow and Shapiro's Code and Data Guide (located under the Pre-Work folder)

2.) Login to KLC through any secure shell client (ssc), described here: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/rs/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster/connecting.aspx

3.) Now that you are on KLC, install a FreeTDS driver.  You can do this by entering the following at the command prompt:
 
 ```console
. /kellogg/bin/freetds_config
```

4.) Finally, request a Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) account by following the instructions provided here: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/rs/data.aspx?DB=wharton-rds 

Good luck, and feel free to reach out to Kellogg Research Support (rs@kellogg.northwestern.edu) if you have issues or questions.
