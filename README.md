# Kellogg Computing Orientation Workshop
Code and instructions for the Kellogg Research Support computing orientation workshop

## Important Pre-work
Before coming to the workshop, you'll need to do two things. First, log onto the Kellogg Linux Cluster (KLC). Second, clone this git repository to your home directory on KLC. At that point you will have access to all of these materials, exactly where you'll need to have them in order to participate in the workshop.

Instructions for performing this pre-work have been added to the current repository's wiki:
