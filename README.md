# Kellogg Computing Orientation Workshop
Code and instructions for the Kellogg Research Support computing orientation workshop

## Important Pre-work
Before coming to the workshop, you'll need to do two things. First, log onto the Kellogg Linux Cluster (KLC). Second, clone this git repository to your home directory. You will then have access to all of these materials where you will need to have them in order to participate in the workshop.

### 1. Log on to KLC

KLC is a part of the Quest Hih Performance Computing Cluster, with dedicated resources for the Kellogg community. More information on KLC can be found [here](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/rs/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster.aspx). We'll learn more about KLC later in the workshop, for now our goal is simply to log on and open up a terminal window. To do that, the preferred method is to use [FastX](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/rs/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster/connecting.aspx#browser):
